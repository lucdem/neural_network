# my_neural_network

v1 - Basic neural network implementation with a PyQt interface for setting parameters and tracking training progress

Planned additions:

- regularization

- improve batch training (process batch as a matrix of inputs instead of looping through the input vectors)

- convolutional layers

- a ui screen to change plotting options

- improve text output at the bottom of the ui

maybes?:

- fork to use pytorch behind the GUI instead of my own implementation?

- improve parallelism of my own implementation?

- add other forms of importing data sets?
